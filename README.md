- Learn whole story of LupisVulpes' art path
- Find out about all LupisVulpes' projects 
- Communicate with other people interested in this artist


## Design

When i designed website i wanted to combine modern website style design with unique style of artist herself
Current design is not final result and i'm planning to make it better from time to time


## Technical information

This website is developed with Laravel and React. I wanted to combine 2 programming languages within popular framework and library for different sides of the project: Backend and Frontend. Laravel provides useful tools for developing server side and makes it easy to deal with generic backend routine. Although i'm using React, i wanted this project to be server side rendering and use React for other reasons despite it's popular way of developing spa application.
To store physical information of arts and animations i used external services such as Google Drive for animations and imgBB for arts
To store information about arts and animations i used MySQL database
